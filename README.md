# tsmon

`tsmon` is a tool that helps develop typescript based applications by automatically transpile and restarting the process when file changes are detected.

## Installation

```bash
npm i -g tsmon
```

## Usage

```bash
tsmon src/bin/standalone.ts
```

## Access Source Code

This is a (Source-available Software)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-available_software]. But you still can get the transpiled js file from [unpkg.com](https://unpkg.com/tsmon@0.2.1/bin/standalone). The typescript source code is only available to our commercial subscription users.
